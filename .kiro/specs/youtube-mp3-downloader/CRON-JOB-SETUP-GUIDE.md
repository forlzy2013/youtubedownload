# CRON Job Setup - Step-by-Step Guide

## Overview

This guide will walk you through setting up an external CRON job to keep your Render Worker alive and prevent cold starts. We'll use **cron-job.org** as it's free, reliable, and easy to configure.

## Why This Matters

- **Problem:** Render's free tier puts services to sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity
- **Impact:** First request after sleep takes 30-60 seconds (bad user experience)
- **Solution:** Ping the worker every 10 minutes to keep it awake
- **Result:** All requests respond in <5 seconds

## Your Worker Details

- **Worker URL:** `https://youtube-mp3-worker.onrender.com`
- **Health Endpoint:** `https://youtube-mp3-worker.onrender.com/health`
- **Ping Frequency:** Every 10 minutes
- **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 with JSON health status

## Step 4: Verify Setup

### 4.1 Wait for First Execution

- The first execution will happen within 10 minutes
- You can see the next scheduled time on the job details page

### 4.2 Check Execution History

After 10 minutes:

1. Go to your cronjob details page
2. Click on **"Execution history"** tab
3. You should see an entry with:
   - **Status:** Succeeded
   - **HTTP Status:** 200
   - **Response time:** ~100-500ms

### 4.3 View Response

1. Click on an execution entry
2. You should see the response body:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "uptime": 12345,
  "timestamp": 1698765432000,
  "queueSize": 0
}
```

### 4.4 Check Render Logs

1. Go to **https://dashboard.render.com**
2. Select your **youtube-mp3-worker** service
3. Click **"Logs"** tab
4. You should see entries like:
```
GET /health 200 - 15ms
GET /health 200 - 12ms
```

---

## Step 5: Test Cold Start Prevention

### 5.1 Wait 20 Minutes

- Don't make any manual requests to the worker
- Let the CRON job do its work

### 5.2 Make a Test Request

After 20 minutes, test the worker:

```bash
curl https://youtube-mp3-worker.onrender.com/health
```

### 5.3 Check Response Time

- **Expected:** Response in <1 second
- **If slow (30-60s):** CRON job is not working correctly

---

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Daily Checks

‚úÖ **Check CRON job status**
- Go to cron-job.org dashboard
- Verify job is still enabled
- Check for any failed executions

‚úÖ **Check email notifications**
- If you receive failure alerts, investigate immediately

### Weekly Checks

‚úÖ **Review execution statistics**
- Go to cronjob ‚Üí "Statistics" tab
- Verify ~1,008 executions per week (6 per hour √ó 24 hours √ó 7 days)
- Success rate should be >99%

‚úÖ **Check Render Worker uptime**
- Go to Render dashboard
- Verify worker has been running continuously
- Check for any unexpected restarts

### Monthly Checks

‚úÖ **Verify free tier usage**
- Render: Should be ~720 hours/month (within 750 hour limit)
- cron-job.org: Unlimited on free tier

‚úÖ **Review response times**
- Check if health checks are consistently fast
- Investigate if response times increase

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: CRON Job Shows "Failed" Status

**Possible Causes:**
1. Render Worker is down
2. Incorrect URL
3. Network timeout

**Solutions:**

1. **Test URL manually:**
```bash
curl https://youtube-mp3-worker.onrender.com/health
```

2. **Check Render Worker status:**
   - Go to Render dashboard
   - Verify service is deployed and running
   - Check logs for errors

3. **Verify URL in CRON job:**
   - Go to cronjob settings
   - Ensure URL is exactly: `https://youtube-mp3-worker.onrender.com/health`
   - No trailing slash, no typos

4. **Increase timeout:**
   - Edit cronjob
   - Set request timeout to 60 seconds
   - Save changes

### Problem: Worker Still Has Cold Starts

**Symptoms:**
- First request after inactivity takes 30-60 seconds

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify CRON job is running:**
   - Check execution history
   - Should see entries every 10 minutes

2. **Check CRON job is enabled:**
   - Go to cronjob details
   - Verify toggle is ON (green)

3. **Reduce ping interval:**
   - Edit cronjob
   - Change schedule to `*/5 * * * *` (every 5 minutes)
   - Note: This doubles the number of requests

4. **Check Render logs:**
   - Verify health checks are being received
   - Look for any errors or warnings

### Problem: Too Many Failed Executions

**Symptoms:**
- Multiple consecutive failures in execution history

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Render Worker health:**
   - Go to Render dashboard
   - Look for deployment errors
   - Check if service is out of memory

2. **Review Render logs:**
   - Look for error messages
   - Check if /health endpoint is working

3. **Temporarily disable notifications:**
   - If getting too many emails
   - Fix the underlying issue first
   - Re-enable notifications after fix

### Problem: CRON Job Account Suspended

**Symptoms:**
- Can't log in to cron-job.org
- Jobs stopped running

**Solutions:**

1. **Contact cron-job.org support:**
   - Email: support@cron-job.org
   - Explain your use case

2. **Use alternative service:**
   - Set up UptimeRobot (see Alternative Options below)
   - Configure with same URL and 5-minute interval

---

## Alternative Options

### Option 1: UptimeRobot

**Pros:**
- Also free
- Provides uptime monitoring dashboard
- 5-minute minimum interval

**Cons:**
- 5-minute interval (vs 10-minute) uses more Render hours
- Limited to 50 monitors on free tier

**Setup:**
1. Go to https://uptimerobot.com
2. Sign up for free account
3. Add new monitor:
   - Type: HTTP(s)
   - URL: `https://youtube-mp3-worker.onrender.com/health`
   - Interval: 5 minutes
4. Save and enable

### Option 2: Koyeb (Alternative to Render)

**Pros:**
- No cold starts (always-on free tier)
- No need for CRON job

**Cons:**
- More complex setup
- Different deployment process

**Note:** Consider if cold starts become a major issue
