# 🚨 URGENT FIX REQUIRED - Wrong Render Worker URL

## 🎯 Root Cause Identified

**The download is failing because Vercel is sending requests to the WRONG Render Worker URL!**

### Current Configuration (WRONG):
```
RENDER_WORKER_URL=https://youtube-mp3-worker.onrender.com
```

### Actual Render Worker URL (from logs):
```
https://youtubedownload-drzg.onrender.com
```

### Evidence:
- Vercel logs show: "Proxy download error: External server returned 404"
- Render logs show: **ONLY `/health` requests, NO `/download` requests**
- This means Vercel is trying to send download requests to a non-existent URL

---

## 🔧 Fix Steps

### Step 1: Update Vercel Environment Variable

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `project4`
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Find `RENDER_WORKER_URL`
5. Change value from:
   ```
   https://youtube-mp3-worker.onrender.com
   ```
   To:
   ```
   https://youtubedownload-drzg.onrender.com
   ```
6. Click **Save**
7. Go to **Deployments** tab
8. Click **Redeploy** on the latest deployment

### Step 2: Update Local .env.local File

```bash
# Open .env.local and change line 23:
RENDER_WORKER_URL=https://youtubedownload-drzg.onrender.com
```

### Step 3: Commit the Change

```bash
git add .env.local
git commit -m "Fix: Update RENDER_WORKER_URL to correct Render deployment URL"
git push origin main
```

## 🧪 Test After Fix

### 1. Wait for Vercel Redeploy (2-3 minutes)

### 2. Test Download Flow

1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Enter YouTube URL
4. Click "Analyze"
5. Click "Download MP3"

### 3. Expected Behavior

**Console Logs:**
```
🎬 Starting download for: ...
🚀 Fast Track download: {...}
❌ Fast Track download failed: ...
🔄 Fast Track link expired, falling back to Stable Track
📡 Requesting Stable Track fallback...
📦 Stable Track response: {type: "async", taskId: "..."}
```

**Render Worker Logs (IMPORTANT!):**
```
2025-10-31T15:XX:XX.XXXZ - POST /download
📥 Received download request for task ...
📋 Task ... queued
✅ Task ... completed successfully
```

**UI:**
- Warning message: "Link expired. Switching to Stable Track..."
- Progress bar appears
- Status updates: "Waiting in queue..." → "Converting to MP3..." → "Complete!"
- File downloads after 30-60 seconds

## 📊 Verification Checklist

After applying the fix:

- [ ] Vercel environment variable updated
- [ ] Vercel redeployed
- [ ] Local .env.local updated
- [ ] Changes committed to Git
- [ ] Browser cache cleared
- [ ] Test download attempted
- [ ] Render Worker receives `/download` request
- [ ] Task processes successfully
- [ ] File downloads

## 🔍 How to Verify Render Worker URL

If you're unsure of the correct URL:

1. Go to Render Dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select your service: `youtubedownload`
3. Look at the top of the page for the URL
4. It should show: `https://youtubedownload-drzg.onrender.com`

---

## 💡 Why This Happened

The `.env.local` file had a placeholder URL (`youtube-mp3-worker.onrender.com`) that was never updated after the actual Render service was deployed with a different name (`youtubedownload-drzg.onrender.com`).

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Without this fix, the Stable Track will NEVER work because:**
1. Fast Track links expire (404)
2. Frontend triggers fallback
3. Vercel creates task in Redis
4. Vercel tries to send request to WRONG URL
5. Request fails silently
6. Render Worker never receives the task
7. Frontend polls forever, task stays at 0%

**This is why you see the progress bar stuck at "Waiting in queue... 0%"**

---

## 🚀 Expected Result After Fix

- Fast Track: Works when links are fresh (~20% of time)
- Stable Track: Works when Fast Track fails (~80% of time)
- Overall success rate: ~95%+
- No more stuck progress bars!
